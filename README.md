# Multi-Agent Systems with AutoGen

This repository contains code examples for building multi-agent applications (powered by generative AI models) based on the [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) framework and is the official code repository for the book - [Multi-Agent Systems with AutoGen](https://mng.bz/eVP9), published by Manning Publications.

In [Multi-Agent Systems with AutoGen](https://mng.bz/eVP9), you will learn about the core components of agents (Generative AI models, tools, memory, orchestration), how to implement them in python code using the AutoGen framework, how to evaluate, optimize and deploy them in your applications. Overall, the book will cover:

- Core components for multi-agent systems and their implementation
- UX design principles for multi-agent systems
- Building agents to interact with various interface (web, mobile, desktop)
- Evaluating your multi-agent system using benchmarks like GAIA, GPTQ, SWEBench and your own custom benchmarks
- Performance optimization (e.g., agent-specific model tuning and parallel processing)
- Use case deep dives like data analysis, customer service, and creativity workflows.
