    "Some tasks often benefit from multiple distinct experts that can be abstracted as individual agents. Consider that our task is build an art exhibition director i.e., given a theme and the number of expected art pieces, they can extend the initial theme, suggest a list of relevant styles and artists, create sample images based on a detailed conceptualization  of each piece, and finally generate a catalog of the exhibition.\n",
    "\n",
    "In theory, we can create a general purpose assistant agent and give it access to many skills that cover a range of expert areas. However, this can make it harder to reason about and debug the agents behavior and also introduces additional challenges as the LLM has to select the right tool or function call at each step. \n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the process of solving these types of tasks, we can create a team of agents, each with specific expertise. For example, we can create an `ArtPlanner` that extends the theme into a detailed plan, an `ArtStyleSelector` that suggests relevant styles and artists, an `ArtConceptualizer` that creates detailed conceptual descriptions, and an `ArtCataloguer` that generates the exhibition catalog. Each agent can be configured with the appropriate tools and LLMs to solve their specific subtask."

This section challenges visitors to consider the ethical implications of blending technology with biology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exit - \"The Reflection Chamber\":\n",
      "A serene, mirrored space allows visitors to reflect on the exhibition and share their thoughts on humanity's future. Digital guestbooks capture visitors' hopes and fears for the future, displayed on a live-feed wall, creating a collective vision of tomorrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "User Experience:\n",

      "For \"Beyond Horizons: The Future of Humanity,\" the exhibition's rich thematic fabric offers a unique canvas to highlight a curated selection of art styles and artists whose works not only resonate with the overarching concept but also deepen the visitor's engagement with each thematic section. The following art styles and artists are proposed to bring this vision to life:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Digital Futurism & Refik Anadol**:\n",
      "   - **Rationale**: To encapsulate the theme of \"Echoes of Technology,\" Refik Anadol's digital futurism offers an unparalleled exploration of the synthesis between artificial intelligence and large-scale public art. Anadol's works, such as \"Machine Hallucination,\" use AI to create immersive environments from vast datasets, embodying the fluidity and dynamism of our technological trajectory. His ability to visualise the invisible data that surrounds us aligns perfectly with the section's aim to visually articulate the intertwined future of humanity and technology. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Sustainable Architectural Design & Vincent Callebaut**:\n",
      "   - **Rationale**: For \"Blueprints of Tomorrow,\" Vincent Callebaut's visionary approach to sustainable architecture presents an inspiring glimpse into future habitats. His projects, such as \"Lilypad,\" a concept for floating eco-polis for climate refugees, provide tangible models for addressing climate change and urban expansion. Integrating Callebaut's designs offers visitors a concrete understanding of how future living spaces can be harmoniously integrated with nature, enriching the exhibition's narrative on sustainable future living environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Interactive Social Commentary & Olafur Eliasson**:\n",
      "   - **Rationale**: \"Weaving the Social Fabric\" seeks to unravel the complex interplay of future social dynamics. Olafur Eliasson’s participatory art, known for its ability to foster community and reflect on societal issues through engagement, serves this purpose effectively. Works like \"The weather project\" in the Tate Modern, which created a microcosm of the sun and invited public interaction, can be the blueprint for installations that encourage visitors to contemplate and contribute to the evolving tapestry of future societies.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Environmental Art & Agnes Denes**:\n",
      "   - **Rationale**: Agnes Denes, with her profound contributions to environmental art, is a fitting choice for \"Terraformed Realms.\" Known for combining ecological, cultural, and historical themes, Denes's works, such as \"Tree Mountain - A Living Time Capsule,\" where she transformed a barren landfill into a sustainable forest, mirror the exhibition's dedication to presenting future Earth scenarios. Her art forms a bridge between environmental action and artistic expression, making her works essential to provoke thought on the ecological choices shaping our planet's future.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Speculative Biotechnology & Patricia Piccinini**:\n",
      "   - **Rationale**: The \"Beyond Human\" section delves into the speculative future of human evolution, making Patricia Piccinini’s hyperreal sculptures an ideal artistic exploration. Piccinini’s engagement with themes of biotechnology, empathy, and the uncanny valley, as seen in works like \"The Young Family,\" challenges viewers to confront the ethical and emotional dimensions of future human and transhuman scenarios. Her ability to humanize genetic manipulation and cyborg futures offers a profound commentary on what it means to be human in an era of rapid technological advancement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Integrating these artists and their distinctive styles into the \"Beyond Horizons: The Future of Humanity\" exhibition provides a multi-faceted dialogue that engages visitors not only visually and intellectually but also emotionally, encouraging a deeper reflection on their role and responsibility in shaping the future.\n",
