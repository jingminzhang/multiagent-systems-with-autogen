    "\n",
    "AutoGen recently released a new version of the [framework (v0.4)](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/0.2/blog/) with an asynchronous event driven api where agents primary act when they receive a message. It introduces the concept of runtimes (which may be single threaded or distributed) and agents that can be run on these runtimes.\n",

    "It also includes a high level API - [AgentChat]() that focuses on providing presets for agent behaviours and how these agents can interact as part of a team or workflow.\n",
