Here is what I remember in one of the episodes: Two men play poker. One folds after another tells him to bet. The one who folded actually had a good hand and fell for the bluff. On the second hand, the same man folds again, but this time with a bad hand. A man gets locked in the room, and then his daughter knocks on the door. Two men go to a butcher shop, and one man brings a gift of vodka.

But after saying he wouldn\u2019t participate he changed his mind and flew into Oxford to level with the American people. At the beginning of the debate, McCain admitted it was mostly his fault.\\\\n\\\\n\u201cIt\u2019s all this deregulation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s market fundamentalism, a misplaced, uninformed belief that the market always corrects itself. All my career, I\u2019ve worked to remove oversight from giant corporations. I\u2019ve trusted the greediest and most ambitious among us to police themselves. I was wrong about that. And I was wrong to advocate going to war in Iraq, wasting $700 billion and 4,000 American lives, destroying that country while the Taliban grew stronger in Afghanistan. Some of the most serious mistakes in the history of America were made by me.\u201d\\\\n\\\\nIt was a shocking thing for him to say. But it was big of him to admit it. After the debate, we played poker.\\\\n\\\\n#### The Game\\\\n\\\\nWe played in my kitchen, our view the windowless backside of Chelsea Gardens, the tacky Mission monument to the next round of gentrification. Adam Krefman had stolen my folding chairs, so I borrowed chairs from Olu, my downstairs neighbor. Dan and Isaac showed up first, then Ben and Tono. Finally, Sarah and Molly. It was nice to have women at the poker table. They wore low-cut shirts and giggled a lot, exploiting stereotypes and pretending like they didn\u2019t know how to play. They won all night.\\\\n\\\\nWe started with Texas Hold\u2019em. Two cards down, five across the middle. Later, we switched to San Francisco Peach Grove, and then Denver Peach Grove. Those are just the names of the games, but it\u2019s the people that matter.\\\\n\\\\nWhen Sarah had a good hand, she would call. She would never raise. And this made Isaac furious. He bet blue chips into her like she was his personal slot machine. And, like most slot machines, she never paid out. She just took it, digesting his money, and smiling like it was an accident. When he had high pair, she had triple queens. When he had a straight, she had a flush. When he thought he had a flush, he didn\u2019t, and when we played high-low Isaac didn\u2019t qualify.\\\\n\\\\n\u201cListen, miss,\u201d Isaac said angrily at one point.\\\\n\\\\n\u201cDid you just call her a bitch?\u201d I asked.\\\\n\\\\n\u201cI did not say that,\u201d Isaac said. \u201cTell him what I said. Otherwise, he\u2019ll put it in the report. Do not write that I called Sarah a bitch.\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\u201cThe poker report never lies,\u201d I said.\\\\n\\\\nThe truth is, Isaac lost to Sarah again and again. He lost so many times it was ridiculous. It was like a slow-motion film of a man punched repeatedly in the face. The man\u2019s arms are at his sides; the fist is coming toward him. You almost want to yell something, like \u201cRaise your arms! Defend yourself!\u201d But you don\u2019t. The back of the fingers line up against the man\u2019s cheekbone, the knuckles rolling into the jaw; a spray of spit flies from his mouth. And then she hits him again. It was a metaphor for all senseless violence. There was Isaac, bluffing half the time, not even a high pair. And there was Sarah, only playing when the cards were perfect, smiling like a carnivore at a meat convention. It was like so many modern conflicts. First, there was some provocation, and then the larger country flew an armada of bombers across the border, and soon everything was burning. And you could see how people become desensitized to violence. You could understand why traffic slows on the highway as the drivers take a long, hard stare at a wrecked car. And you could understand movies like Pulp Fiction and Scream, where people are killed in mean and senseless ways yet somehow it\u2019s funny, somehow we\u2019re still able to sleep at night. And we all sat calmly laughing, unaware of our own cruelty, even as Sarah did to Isaac what a butcher does first to a plucked chicken.\\\\n\\\\nMolly played with a similar strategy. She\u2019s recently married. Her husband, Chanan, was supposed to play, but Molly wouldn\u2019t let him out on a Friday night when there was still cleaning to do at home. Since her wedding, a couple of weeks ago, Molly has carried her beauty differently. Before, it was like a secret, but now it\u2019s a flashlight she\u2019s shining in your eye. \u201cI have such terrible cards,\u201d she would say, turning her face in profile. \u201cI should fold.\u201d But her cards held up. She won all the time. On most hands, she didn\u2019t even ante. She couldn\u2019t be bothered to throw in the quarter. And nobody had the guts to tell her. We all knew what she had done to Chanan.\\\\n\\\\nIf there was a loser for the night, it was Dollar Dan Weiss, a distant relative of Harry Houdini and one half of the fabled San Francisco band the Progressive Reading Series All-Star Minstrels. Dan makes most of his money working in a new-and-used-book store. In other words, he makes very little money and lives on the tail end of a dying industry. Like many publishers, he doesn\u2019t know when to fold. In fact, Dan never folded. \u201cIt\u2019s more fun to bet,\u201d he said. And he kept tossing quarters and red chips and whatever else onto the felt. He lost $24 in all. Mostly to Tono.\\\\n\\\\nTono was the big winner for the night. Which is a little scary, because Tono\u2019s a known cheater. With two beautiful women directly across the table, nobody was watching Tono very closely, which is unusual for him. He\u2019s just visiting from Colorado. He was Ben\u2019s college roommate. Ben, who\u2019s never done a bad thing in his entire life, becomes someone different when Tono\u2019s in town. He becomes Bad Ben and does nothing but drink, smoke, and gamble for four days. I thought that would change after the birth of his daughter six months ago. But I was wrong about that.\\\\n\\\\n\u201cHow\u2019s T.?\u201d someone asked him through the haze of smoke.\\\\n\\\\n\u201cWho?\u201d he replied.\\\\n\\\\n\u201cYour daughter.\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\u201cWhere\u2019s my beer?\u201d\\\\n\\\\n#### The Upshot\\\\n\\\\nThe game went late. Vanessa came over, as did Tori. Olu came up for a little while to make sure we weren\u2019t fucking up his chairs. At one point, I realized there were four gorgeous women in my kitchen, and two of them were playing poker. The other two were like cheerleaders. Three of them were seriously drunk. How did this happen? I asked myself. When did I become trustworthy?\\\\n\\\\nAnd then it was over. Or kind of. Congress is on the verge of a bailout; nobody\u2019s sure if it will work. The country\u2019s already $11 trillion in debt\u2014what\u2019s $1 trillion more? People stuck around for a bit, helped me put away the table, bring Olu his chairs back, bag up the recycling. Isaac asked if he could sleep on my couch, and then left. Everything went back to normal. But what if John McCain won the election? What then? It was like imagining a world without sunlight. Would any of this matter, these games, this kitchen, these doors? Would we still play poker, or would we only play poker? In the end, poker is a game of hope. Sometimes it\u2019s a game for suckers, but the best players are optimistic realists. They\u2019re people who believe something good can still come out of this mess. The worst poker players are cynics. They stick with what they know, even when it\u2019s a losing hand. They don\u2019t enjoy the game, but they don\u2019t know how else to spend their days. They\u2019re terrified of change. They\u2019re old before their time, and even older when their time comes. They\u2019re like CEOs of failed companies asking to be hired based on their experience.\\\\n\\\\nBarack Obama plays poker. John McCain\u2019s game is craps. McCain\u2019s been known to stand at the long Vegas table, bug-eyed, swathed in green light, blowing on the dice, ignoring aides imploring him to leave. When McCain gets going at the craps table, his mouth gets a hard line to it, his shoulders pull together, and his brow stretches so tight it\u2019s like his forehead\u2019s going to rip. He doesn\u2019t hear or recognize what\u2019s going on around him. He stays focused on the task at hand, without food or sleep, until all the money\u2019s gone. Craps isn\u2019t like poker. In poker, you have a chance, but in craps you\u2019re playing against the house. And you should never bet against the house with your own money. Because the house always wins.\\\\n\\\\nStephen Elliott  \\\\nEditor  \\\\nThe Poker Report\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\\\- - -\\\\n\\\\nJune 23, 2008  \\\\n_\u201cSucker-Free and Out of Gas Since 2001\u201d_\\\\n\\\\n#### Guest Writer\u2014Isaac \u201cthe Debtor\u201d Fitzgerald\\\\n\\\\nIt\u2019s hard to lose when you show up to a poker game with no money. There\u2019s dignity, I guess, but whatever dignity I could scrape together probably wouldn\u2019t have covered the $20 buy-in. Still, I decided to go to Steve\u2019s house in hopes that he was feeling generous, as friends sometimes do. When I walked in the door, he immediately offered to pay for my dinner if I\u2019d go pick both of ours up at the grocer\u2019s around the corner. Things were looking up.\\\\n\\\\nBy the time I returned with two pints of piping-hot white-bean-and-pork soup, Steve had his poker table, all red felt and busted legs, set up. The other players had arrived and were jammed in around the rickety table in Steve\u2019s small living room. Steve clamored over the couch behind his friend Otis, who was visiting from Knoxville and looked a bit like a shark hunter, to put on some music. We were going to have to keep our cards close to our chests.\\\\n\\\\nJason Roberts, Tom Barbash, and Adam Krefman all brought beer. Chanan brought potato chips, and Josh confused everybody by bringing a bottle of wine. Eli Horowitz, whom the L.A. Weekly had just inexplicably dubbed \u201cMcSweeney\u2019s boyish publisher,\u201d was also in attendance. Eli has a face cut from granite that could only be described as aged and haggard. I wondered about the L.A. Weekly\u2019s fact checkers.\\\\n\\\\nThe moment I walked in the door, Steve asked for his change from the soup, which I was hoping to pocket, and for my buy-in. I gave Steve a look that said \u201cCould you cover me?\u201d It was a look I know he\u2019d given many times in his life. In this regard, Steve and I speak the same language. We\u2019re both city kids who have had our share of empty-pocket adventures, and I was relying on a sense of brotherhood. Steve knew I had had an interesting year, and that interesting years didn\u2019t usually lead to big bank accounts. Sometimes, but not usually. This one certainly hadn\u2019t; it had been the kind of year where you end up working at a biker bar, then find yourself smuggling medical supplies on the Thai/Burma border, only to wake up in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, with a giant tattoo of a tall ship on your rib cage for absolutely no reason. I\u2019ve never even been on a sailboat.\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately, Steve also knew I had just gotten a new job. A 9-to-5. I got paid with checks now, taxes taken out and everything. No more fistfuls of dirty bills with drugs still on them, just a clean check every two weeks like clockwork. I was getting my shit together, and Steve gave me a look that said \u201cPeople with their shit together don\u2019t come to poker night empty-handed.\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\u201cDon\u2019t get my first check till next week,\u201d I shrugged.\\\\n\\\\n\u201cOK, but if you lose it all I\u2019m not covering you to buy back in.\u201d\\\\n\\\\nI smiled, confident that I\u2019d be paying him back out of my winnings in just a few hours.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\\\- - -\\\\n\\\\nWe started out with Texas Hold \u2018Em, which would rule the table for most of the night. Chanan took an early lead, winning the first three hands, taking me to the mat every time. Steve tried to instigate an ethnic war between us (despite my Hebrew name, I\u2019m Irish Catholic), but there isn\u2019t much hatred between the Irish and the Jews, and Steve\u2019s instigations fell flat.\\\\n\\\\nBarbash muttered something about not knowing the rules and we took a break while Josh drew up a list of which hands beat which for him.\\\\n\\\\n\u201cOldest trick in the book,\u201d Otis muttered. I agreed\\\\n\\\\nAdam dealt the next hand. The flop was the seven of spades with the jack of hearts along with his king. Tom, after scrutinizing his sheet, immediately started betting big, humbling even Steve, who doesn\u2019t usually let other people\u2019s bets push him around. I wasn\u2019t buying it, though. I agreed with Otis and figured Tom was a seasoned player who was looking at the cheat sheet for dramatic effect while winning some easy chips. The five of hearts came on the turn, and then the five of diamonds on the river. I only had ace high. Tom laid down one last large bet, I matched it, and then we showed. Tom took me with a flush. It had now been four straight hands and I\u2019d stayed in till the end on every one only to lose.\\\\n\\\\nStephen smiled.\\\\n\\\\n\u201cSlow it down.\u201d Eli was sitting next to my right, his old voice like gravel.

So many of us who took part in the Great Resignation are caught between new possibilities and the same old challenges. These stories, too, reflect a kind of straining towards something hopeful but uncertain: a woman whose discoveries lead her to trying on new lives after a breakup, a man pulled between two loves, a medic whose own wounds impede his ability to bind a broken society. Wherever this year of in-between finds you, may these stories provide a vision of what lies ahead and inspiration for the journey._\\\\n\\\\n_\u2014Jonathan Freeman-Coppadge  \\\\nFiction Editor_\\\\n\\\\n _Reading this year\u2019s stories, one is struck by the ways each author presents stasis, loss and change. As you read them, you will notice how each story considers these perennial, broad themes, while making sure to step outside their shadow. Some characters face their mortality, repress their fears, and even endure violent intrusions upon their lives. Yet some grow, whether that means learning to forgive yourself or the overcoming of an obstacle once thought impossible. Finally, I hope you appreciate each story as much as I appreciated the chance to help publish them._\\\\n\\\\n_\u2014 Nicholas Dharmadi  \\\\nFiction Editorial Intern_\\\\n\\\\n _When I read fiction, I search for the truth in it. I search for stories that settle in and stay with me, move me. This year, the selected Emerging Voices pieces organically came together to explore loss and shame. Shame is an emotion often felt but not often expressed, these stories give voice to it. When we see reflections of ourselves in fiction \u2014 we feel connection. Stories unite us. It is a privilege to read emerging writers\u2019 work, to be part of their writing journey, and I hope as a reader you feel inspired by their words, too._\\\\n\\\\n_\u2014 Stephanie Fluckey  \\\\nGuest Editor, Emerging Voices in Fiction_\\\\n\\\\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/584a1a70ff7c5026f7c27520/2a39236f-e887-4e26-ae2c-5946b8d15f0a/In+The+Line.jpg)\\\\n\\\\n## [In the Line](https://www.oysterriverpages.com/in-the-line)\\\\n\\\\n### Nur Turkmani\\\\n\\\\nThe heat outside my car is oppressive, like being forced to drink soup under the sun, but I cannot risk turning the air conditioning on with the little fuel I have.

One of the most striking additions to the Berlin skyline is the pyramid-shaped Memorial Arch which D1 Howard passes on the way to his D2 apartment. Creator Justin Marks explains \"I don\u2019t want to get into too many spoilers, but the Memorial Arch for the victims of [The Flu](https://counterpartstarz.fandom.com/wiki/The_Flu \"The Flu\") which is this triangular thing that sits there. ...

The decided it was Pappy Van Winkle. \\n\\nThis episode provides the best, albeit a very dark, look inside the crossing between the two dimensions.

But after saying he wouldn\u2019t participate he changed his mind and flew into Oxford to level with the American people. At the beginning of the debate, McCain admitted it was mostly his fault.\\n\\n\u201cIt\u2019s all this deregulation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s market fundamentalism, a misplaced, uninformed belief that the market always corrects itself. All my career, I\u2019ve worked to remove oversight from giant corporations. I\u2019ve trusted the greediest and most ambitious among us to police themselves. I was wrong about that. And I was wrong to advocate going to war in Iraq, wasting $700 billion and 4,000 American lives, destroying that country while the Taliban grew stronger in Afghanistan. Some of the most serious mistakes in the history of America were made by me.\u201d\\n\\nIt was a shocking thing for him to say. But it was big of him to admit it. After the debate, we played poker.\\n\\n#### The Game\\n\\nWe played in my kitchen, our view the windowless backside of Chelsea Gardens, the tacky Mission monument to the next round of gentrification. Adam Krefman had stolen my folding chairs, so I borrowed chairs from Olu, my downstairs neighbor. Dan and Isaac showed up first, then Ben and Tono. Finally, Sarah and Molly. It was nice to have women at the poker table. They wore low-cut shirts and giggled a lot, exploiting stereotypes and pretending like they didn\u2019t know how to play. They won all night.\\n\\nWe started with Texas Hold\u2019em. Two cards down, five across the middle. Later, we switched to San Francisco Peach Grove, and then Denver Peach Grove. Those are just the names of the games, but it\u2019s the people that matter.\\n\\nWhen Sarah had a good hand, she would call. She would never raise. And this made Isaac furious. He bet blue chips into her like she was his personal slot machine. And, like most slot machines, she never paid out. She just took it, digesting his money, and smiling like it was an accident. When he had high pair, she had triple queens. When he had a straight, she had a flush. When he thought he had a flush, he didn\u2019t, and when we played high-low Isaac didn\u2019t qualify.\\n\\n\u201cListen, miss,\u201d Isaac said angrily at one point.\\n\\n\u201cDid you just call her a bitch?\u201d I asked.\\n\\n\u201cI did not say that,\u201d Isaac said. \u201cTell him what I said. Otherwise, he\u2019ll put it in the report. Do not write that I called Sarah a bitch.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cThe poker report never lies,\u201d I said.\\n\\nThe truth is, Isaac lost to Sarah again and again. He lost so many times it was ridiculous. It was like a slow-motion film of a man punched repeatedly in the face. The man\u2019s arms are at his sides; the fist is coming toward him. You almost want to yell something, like \u201cRaise your arms! Defend yourself!\u201d But you don\u2019t. The back of the fingers line up against the man\u2019s cheekbone, the knuckles rolling into the jaw; a spray of spit flies from his mouth. And then she hits him again. It was a metaphor for all senseless violence. There was Isaac, bluffing half the time, not even a high pair. And there was Sarah, only playing when the cards were perfect, smiling like a carnivore at a meat convention. It was like so many modern conflicts. First, there was some provocation, and then the larger country flew an armada of bombers across the border, and soon everything was burning. And you could see how people become desensitized to violence. You could understand why traffic slows on the highway as the drivers take a long, hard stare at a wrecked car. And you could understand movies like Pulp Fiction and Scream, where people are killed in mean and senseless ways yet somehow it\u2019s funny, somehow we\u2019re still able to sleep at night. And we all sat calmly laughing, unaware of our own cruelty, even as Sarah did to Isaac what a butcher does first to a plucked chicken.\\n\\nMolly played with a similar strategy. She\u2019s recently married. Her husband, Chanan, was supposed to play, but Molly wouldn\u2019t let him out on a Friday night when there was still cleaning to do at home. Since her wedding, a couple of weeks ago, Molly has carried her beauty differently. Before, it was like a secret, but now it\u2019s a flashlight she\u2019s shining in your eye. \u201cI have such terrible cards,\u201d she would say, turning her face in profile. \u201cI should fold.\u201d But her cards held up. She won all the time. On most hands, she didn\u2019t even ante. She couldn\u2019t be bothered to throw in the quarter. And nobody had the guts to tell her. We all knew what she had done to Chanan.\\n\\nIf there was a loser for the night, it was Dollar Dan Weiss, a distant relative of Harry Houdini and one half of the fabled San Francisco band the Progressive Reading Series All-Star Minstrels. Dan makes most of his money working in a new-and-used-book store. In other words, he makes very little money and lives on the tail end of a dying industry. Like many publishers, he doesn\u2019t know when to fold. In fact, Dan never folded. \u201cIt\u2019s more fun to bet,\u201d he said. And he kept tossing quarters and red chips and whatever else onto the felt. He lost $24 in all. Mostly to Tono.\\n\\nTono was the big winner for the night. Which is a little scary, because Tono\u2019s a known cheater. With two beautiful women directly across the table, nobody was watching Tono very closely, which is unusual for him. He\u2019s just visiting from Colorado. He was Ben\u2019s college roommate. Ben, who\u2019s never done a bad thing in his entire life, becomes someone different when Tono\u2019s in town. He becomes Bad Ben and does nothing but drink, smoke, and gamble for four days. I thought that would change after the birth of his daughter six months ago. But I was wrong about that.\\n\\n\u201cHow\u2019s T.?\u201d someone asked him through the haze of smoke.\\n\\n\u201cWho?\u201d he replied.\\n\\n\u201cYour daughter.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cWhere\u2019s my beer?\u201d\\n\\n#### The Upshot\\n\\nThe game went late. Vanessa came over, as did Tori. Olu came up for a little while to make sure we weren\u2019t fucking up his chairs. At one point, I realized there were four gorgeous women in my kitchen, and two of them were playing poker. The other two were like cheerleaders. Three of them were seriously drunk. How did this happen? I asked myself. When did I become trustworthy?\\n\\nAnd then it was over. Or kind of. Congress is on the verge of a bailout; nobody\u2019s sure if it will work. The country\u2019s already $11 trillion in debt\u2014what\u2019s $1 trillion more? People stuck around for a bit, helped me put away the table, bring Olu his chairs back, bag up the recycling. Isaac asked if he could sleep on my couch, and then left. Everything went back to normal. But what if John McCain won the election? What then? It was like imagining a world without sunlight. Would any of this matter, these games, this kitchen, these doors? Would we still play poker, or would we only play poker? In the end, poker is a game of hope. Sometimes it\u2019s a game for suckers, but the best players are optimistic realists. They\u2019re people who believe something good can still come out of this mess. The worst poker players are cynics. They stick with what they know, even when it\u2019s a losing hand. They don\u2019t enjoy the game, but they don\u2019t know how else to spend their days. They\u2019re terrified of change. They\u2019re old before their time, and even older when their time comes. They\u2019re like CEOs of failed companies asking to be hired based on their experience.\\n\\nBarack Obama plays poker. John McCain\u2019s game is craps. McCain\u2019s been known to stand at the long Vegas table, bug-eyed, swathed in green light, blowing on the dice, ignoring aides imploring him to leave. When McCain gets going at the craps table, his mouth gets a hard line to it, his shoulders pull together, and his brow stretches so tight it\u2019s like his forehead\u2019s going to rip. He doesn\u2019t hear or recognize what\u2019s going on around him. He stays focused on the task at hand, without food or sleep, until all the money\u2019s gone. Craps isn\u2019t like poker. In poker, you have a chance, but in craps you\u2019re playing against the house. And you should never bet against the house with your own money. Because the house always wins.\\n\\nStephen Elliott  \\nEditor  \\nThe Poker Report\\n\\n\\\\- - -\\n\\nJune 23, 2008  \\n_\u201cSucker-Free and Out of Gas Since 2001\u201d_\\n\\n#### Guest Writer\u2014Isaac \u201cthe Debtor\u201d Fitzgerald\\n\\nIt\u2019s hard to lose when you show up to a poker game with no money. There\u2019s dignity, I guess, but whatever dignity I could scrape together probably wouldn\u2019t have covered the $20 buy-in. Still, I decided to go to Steve\u2019s house in hopes that he was feeling generous, as friends sometimes do. When I walked in the door, he immediately offered to pay for my dinner if I\u2019d go pick both of ours up at the grocer\u2019s around the corner. Things were looking up.\\n\\nBy the time I returned with two pints of piping-hot white-bean-and-pork soup, Steve had his poker table, all red felt and busted legs, set up. The other players had arrived and were jammed in around the rickety table in Steve\u2019s small living room. Steve clamored over the couch behind his friend Otis, who was visiting from Knoxville and looked a bit like a shark hunter, to put on some music. We were going to have to keep our cards close to our chests.\\n\\nJason Roberts, Tom Barbash, and Adam Krefman all brought beer. Chanan brought potato chips, and Josh confused everybody by bringing a bottle of wine. Eli Horowitz, whom the L.A. Weekly had just inexplicably dubbed \u201cMcSweeney\u2019s boyish publisher,\u201d was also in attendance. Eli has a face cut from granite that could only be described as aged and haggard. I wondered about the L.A. Weekly\u2019s fact checkers.\\n\\nThe moment I walked in the door, Steve asked for his change from the soup, which I was hoping to pocket, and for my buy-in. I gave Steve a look that said \u201cCould you cover me?\u201d It was a look I know he\u2019d given many times in his life. In this regard, Steve and I speak the same language. We\u2019re both city kids who have had our share of empty-pocket adventures, and I was relying on a sense of brotherhood. Steve knew I had had an interesting year, and that interesting years didn\u2019t usually lead to big bank accounts. Sometimes, but not usually. This one certainly hadn\u2019t; it had been the kind of year where you end up working at a biker bar, then find yourself smuggling medical supplies on the Thai/Burma border, only to wake up in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, with a giant tattoo of a tall ship on your rib cage for absolutely no reason. I\u2019ve never even been on a sailboat.\\n\\nUnfortunately, Steve also knew I had just gotten a new job. A 9-to-5. I got paid with checks now, taxes taken out and everything. No more fistfuls of dirty bills with drugs still on them, just a clean check every two weeks like clockwork. I was getting my shit together, and Steve gave me a look that said \u201cPeople with their shit together don\u2019t come to poker night empty-handed.\u201d\\n\\n\u201cDon\u2019t get my first check till next week,\u201d I shrugged.\\n\\n\u201cOK, but if you lose it all I\u2019m not covering you to buy back in.\u201d\\n\\nI smiled, confident that I\u2019d be paying him back out of my winnings in just a few hours.\\n\\n\\\\- - -\\n\\nWe started out with Texas Hold \u2018Em, which would rule the table for most of the night. Chanan took an early lead, winning the first three hands, taking me to the mat every time. Steve tried to instigate an ethnic war between us (despite my Hebrew name, I\u2019m Irish Catholic), but there isn\u2019t much hatred between the Irish and the Jews, and Steve\u2019s instigations fell flat.\\n\\nBarbash muttered something about not knowing the rules and we took a break while Josh drew up a list of which hands beat which for him.\\n\\n\u201cOldest trick in the book,\u201d Otis muttered. I agreed\\n\\nAdam dealt the next hand. The flop was the seven of spades with the jack of hearts along with his king. Tom, after scrutinizing his sheet, immediately started betting big, humbling even Steve, who doesn\u2019t usually let other people\u2019s bets push him around. I wasn\u2019t buying it, though. I agreed with Otis and figured Tom was a seasoned player who was looking at the cheat sheet for dramatic effect while winning some easy chips. The five of hearts came on the turn, and then the five of diamonds on the river. I only had ace high. Tom laid down one last large bet, I matched it, and then we showed. Tom took me with a flush. It had now been four straight hands and I\u2019d stayed in till the end on every one only to lose.\\n\\nStephen smiled.\\n\\n\u201cSlow it down.\u201d Eli was sitting next to my right, his old voice like gravel.

So many of us who took part in the Great Resignation are caught between new possibilities and the same old challenges. These stories, too, reflect a kind of straining towards something hopeful but uncertain: a woman whose discoveries lead her to trying on new lives after a breakup, a man pulled between two loves, a medic whose own wounds impede his ability to bind a broken society. Wherever this year of in-between finds you, may these stories provide a vision of what lies ahead and inspiration for the journey._\\n\\n_\u2014Jonathan Freeman-Coppadge  \\nFiction Editor_\\n\\n _Reading this year\u2019s stories, one is struck by the ways each author presents stasis, loss and change. As you read them, you will notice how each story considers these perennial, broad themes, while making sure to step outside their shadow. Some characters face their mortality, repress their fears, and even endure violent intrusions upon their lives. Yet some grow, whether that means learning to forgive yourself or the overcoming of an obstacle once thought impossible. Finally, I hope you appreciate each story as much as I appreciated the chance to help publish them._\\n\\n_\u2014 Nicholas Dharmadi  \\nFiction Editorial Intern_\\n\\n _When I read fiction, I search for the truth in it. I search for stories that settle in and stay with me, move me. This year, the selected Emerging Voices pieces organically came together to explore loss and shame. Shame is an emotion often felt but not often expressed, these stories give voice to it. When we see reflections of ourselves in fiction \u2014 we feel connection. Stories unite us. It is a privilege to read emerging writers\u2019 work, to be part of their writing journey, and I hope as a reader you feel inspired by their words, too._\\n\\n_\u2014 Stephanie Fluckey  \\nGuest Editor, Emerging Voices in Fiction_\\n\\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/584a1a70ff7c5026f7c27520/2a39236f-e887-4e26-ae2c-5946b8d15f0a/In+The+Line.jpg)\\n\\n## [In the Line](https://www.oysterriverpages.com/in-the-line)\\n\\n### Nur Turkmani\\n\\nThe heat outside my car is oppressive, like being forced to drink soup under the sun, but I cannot risk turning the air conditioning on with the little fuel I have.

party in the makin\\'  \\nAnd the igloos are a shakin\\'  \\nAt the top of the world today.\\n\\nSix months of dark\\'s a bummer  \\nSo they invent a little summer  \\nIt doesn\\'t take much  \\nJust a decorator\\'s touch  \\nIn a tropical state of mind  \\nAnd of course you add some wine  \\nAnd that\\'s when it\\'s time to play.\\n\\nSo turn up the heat  \\nAnd chill the rose  \\nTake off your UGGS  \\nAnd let your metatarsals play  \\nEventhough the South of France  \\nIs 10,000 miles away  \\nYou can turn up the heat  \\nAnd chill the ros\u00e9. \\n\\nYeah yeah hey  \\nYeah yeah hey  \\nyeah yeah yeah\\n\\nThe grapes out on the ocean  \\nGonna feel some kind of motion  \\nYou don\\'t want that pink wine bruisin\\'  \\nWhen that juice boat starts cruisin\\'  \\nYou need some imagination  \\nTo deal with temperature fluctuation  \\nNobody wants to get burned.\\n\\nI don\\'t wanna be the last  \\nAnd I\\'m surely not the first  \\nBut out in the Sahara  \\nA man could die of thirst  \\nSo before I left for Africa  \\nI planned for that mistaica  \\ntook rose from Porquerolles\\'  \\nAnd coffee from Jamaica\\n\\nSo Turn up the heat  \\nChill the rose  \\nStretch out on the beach  \\nAnd let your metatarsals play  \\nEventhough Le Select  \\nIs 10,000 miles away  \\nYou\\'ll survive the desert heat  \\nIf you chill the ros\u00e9.\\n\\nNo matter if your North  \\nOr South of the Equator  \\nYou can pour it over ice  \\nOr right from the \\'frigerator  \\nIt\\'s a message in a bottle  \\nA tool to be cool  \\nCool cool cool...  \\nCool cool...\\n\\nNow you know that outerspace  \\nIs a very frigid place  \\nThere\\'s nothing to sustain us  \\nOn the way out past Uranus  \\nIF we\\'re gonna ride these rockets  \\nWe need protein in our pockets  \\nAnd a little wine for the ride.\\n\\nSo if you\\'re looking for adventure  \\nDon\\'t forget about thirst quenchers  \\nLife can be a banana split  \\nIt can also turn to shit  \\nAnd if you\\'re out of tweeter range  \\nAnd the landscape\\'s gettin\\' strange  \\nHere\\'s my advice to you...\\n\\nTurn up the heat  \\nand chill the rose  \\nTake off your UGGS  \\nAnd let your metatarsals play  \\nEventhough La Bete Nazelles???  \\nIs 10,000 miles away  \\nYou\\'ll survice the summer heat  \\nIf you chill the ros\u00e9\\n\\nyeah Yeah hey  \\nyeah yeah yeah  \\nyeah hey hey\\n\\nSo turn up the heat  \\nAnd Chill the rose  \\nStretch out on the beach  \\nAnd let your metatarsals play  \\nEventhough the ocean\\'s closin  \\nAnd there\\'s mountains of sorbet??  \\nWe\\'ll survive this
