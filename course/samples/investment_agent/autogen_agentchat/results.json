This justifies allocating a moderate to substantial percentage of the portfolio toward equities, which generally outperform over extended horizons, while also incorporating fixed-income securities to provide stability.\n\n4. **Retirement Goal**:\n   - Planning for retirement necessitates efforts to maintain purchasing power post-retirement. Investments must outpace inflation while ensuring protection against market downturns as the individual nears retirement age.\n   - Over time, a gradual \"glide path\" towards a more conservative portfolio, particularly closer to retirement, would reduce risk.\n\n---\n\n#### **Investment Proposal**:\nBased on the profile provided, below is a proposed asset allocation with a focus on diversification while keeping a moderately balanced risk level:\n\n1. **Equities** (60%):\n   - Rationale: Growth potential, capital gains, and dividend income to build long-term wealth.\n   - **Allocation Breakdown**:\n       - **U.S. Large-Cap Stocks (30%)**: Stability and growth from established companies (e.g., S&P 500 index ETF or mutual fund).\n       - **U.S. Small/Mid-Cap Stocks (15%)**: Provide exposure to companies with higher growth potential but slightly more risk.\n       - **International Developed Markets (10%)**: Diversification from global economic growth.\n       - **Emerging Markets (5%)**: Greater long-term growth prospects, albeit higher risk.\n\n2. **Fixed Income** (30%):\n   - Rationale: Stability, predictability, and protection against portfolio volatility.\n   - **Allocation Breakdown**:\n       - **Investment-Grade Corporate Bonds (15%)**: Higher yield than government bonds while maintaining reasonable credit risk.\n       - **Government Bonds (10%)**: Safe and lower-risk investments to offset volatility in equities.\n       - **High-Yield Bonds (5%)**: Offers increased income but balanced as a smaller portion due to moderate risk tolerance.\n\n3. **Alternative Investments** (5%):\n   - Rationale: Adds further diversification and potential growth.\n   - **Allocation Breakdown**:\n       - Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs): Can offer income and hedge against inflation by capitalizing on property value appreciation.\n\n4. **Cash/Cash Equivalents** (5%):\n   - Rationale: Provides liquidity for emergencies or short-term needs.\n   - **Allocation Breakdown**:\n       - Money market funds or high-yield savings account.\n       - Treasury bills or short-term certificates of deposit (CDs).\n\n---\n\n#### **Additional Recommendations**:\n\n1. **Tax Efficiency**:\n   - Maximize contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or IRA to reduce taxable income and grow investments tax deferred.\n   - Consider utilizing a Roth IRA for after-tax contributions to benefit from tax-free withdrawals during retirement (if client qualifies based on income limits).\n\n2. **Monthly Contributions**:\n   - Regular monthly or quarterly contributions (dollar-cost averaging) will mitigate the impact of market fluctuations over time and leverage compounding growth.\n\n3. **Portfolio Rebalancing**:\n   - Conduct annual rebalancing to maintain the target asset allocation, especially if certain assets outperform or underperform.\n\n4. **Inflation Hedge**:\n   - Add Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) or allocate a small portion to commodities (e.g., gold) as a hedge against inflation closer to retirement.\n\n5. **Insurance and Estate Planning**:\n   - Evaluate life and disability insurance needs to protect income-earning capability and dependents (if applicable).\n   - Incorporate estate planning with a will or trust to ensure seamless legacy transfer.\n\n---\n\n#### **Proposed Portfolio Timeline**:\n- Years 1\u201315: Maintain the initial allocation (60% equities, 30% fixed income, 10% alternatives/cash equivalents) for growth and compounding.\n- Years 16\u201320: Gradually decrease equity allocation (to 40\u201350%) and increase fixed income (to 40\u201350%) to preserve accumulated wealth and reduce risk closer to retirement.\n\nPROFILE COMPLETE\n---------- research_strategist ----------\n### **RESEARCH QUERIES**:\n\n#### **Primary Focus: Portfolio Development for Moderate-Risk Retirement Planning**  \nClient: 45-year-old, $200k annual income, 20-year horizon, moderate risk tolerance.\n\n---\n\n### **Research Queries**:\n\n#### 1. **Equity Investment Opportunities** (High Priority)\n   - \"Top moderate-risk U.S. large-cap ETFs 2024 5-year returns expense ratios\"\n   - \"Best U.S. small/mid-cap ETFs for 20-year growth potential moderate risk\"\n   - \"Performance comparison international developed vs emerging markets ETFs 5-year trends expense ratios\"\n\n   **Required Data Points**: 5-year historical returns, expense ratios, dividend yields, and risk/volatility measures (e.g., beta).\n\n   **Context**: Equities will form 60% of the portfolio for long-term growth.

Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market volatility, the Fund\u2019s current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value (NAV) with all distributions reinvested. Returns for other classes of shares offered by the Fund are different. Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative. Performance prior to December 31, 2016 reflects the performance of the Fund\u2019s former adviser, Calvert Investment Management, Inc.

Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product\\\\\\'s monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.  \\\\n  \\\\nThe Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Star ratings do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales load. Hollow stars denote Morningstar Extended Performance Ratings and are considered estimates based on the performance of the fund\\\\\\'s oldest share class, adjusted for fees and expenses.  \\\\n  \\\\n\u00a92024 Morningstar.

Still, recent results highlight that small-cap investing is not without risks and that those risks are amplified by the [shifting structure](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/why-bother-with-small-cap-etfs) of the market. Certain small-cap ETFs offer compelling opportunities under a backdrop of declining interest rates and low valuations, but investors should be selective in which ETF they take off the shelf.\\\\n\\\\n####  Growth of 10,000 \\\\n\\\\nSource: Morningstar Direct. Data as of 01/31/2025.\\\\n\\\\nSmall-cap stocks have had a tough time keeping up with their large-cap counterparts. The [Morningstar US Large Cap Index](https://indexes.morningstar.com/indexes/details/morningstar-us-large-cap-FSUSA00KH5?currency=USD&variant=TR&tab=performance) outpaced the [Morningstar US Small Cap Index](https://indexes.morningstar.com/indexes/details/morningstar-us-small-cap-FSUSA00KGS?currency=USD&variant=TR&tab=performance) by more than 2 percentage points annualized over the past 20 years, with the gap widening to almost 6 percentage points for the past decade. Heightened risk for small caps and better-perceived growth potential of some large-cap stocks likely contribute to this widening deficit.\\\\n\\\\n[Read more: Why Bother With Small-Cap ETFs](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/why-bother-with-small-cap-etfs)\\\\n\\\\n## The Seen Risks of Small Stocks\\\\n\\\\nSmall companies are risky in part because they don\u2019t usually possess the same competitive advantages as larger firms. Only 2% of companies in the small-cap index boast a wide [Morningstar Economic Moat Rating](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/morningstar-economic-moat-rating-3), compared with 76% of firms in the large-cap index. The financial performance of wide-moat companies is usually more stable and predictable than for narrow- or no-moat companies, helping the large-cap index to about one third less annualized volatility than the small-cap index over the past two decades.\\\\n\\\\nSmall caps should have an edge during bull markets, though. The relative size and competitive positioning of small companies allow them to quickly capitalize on new business opportunities. These opportunities may be risky but can lead to big payoffs for firms that execute effectively. Small companies are also more sensitive to interest rates, which can fuel further growth during low-rate environments. Small-cap stocks can perform especially well when markets rise and when interest rates are low, but they may underwhelm when rates are high and markets are shaky.\\\\n\\\\n## The Unseen Risks of Small Stocks\\\\n\\\\nThere are two less visible risks small-cap ETF investors should be aware of:\\\\n\\\\n  1. Small-cap stocks are less liquid than large-cap stocks, raising transaction costs, which hurts returns.\\\\n  2. Small-cap indexes may lack the excitement and potential they once had, shifting the investment case.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nChoosing an ETF with the smallest average market cap is not a recipe for success. Smaller stocks are more volatile, but they\u2019re also less liquid. The former may amplify drawdowns, and the latter creates a drag on returns.\\\\n\\\\nIndex funds periodically rebalance to maintain a close link to their benchmark. At each rebalance, an index fund must buy and sell sometimes billions of dollars\u2019 worth of securities. These trades cost very little for large, liquid stocks like Apple [AAPL](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/aapl/quote) and Nvidia [NVDA](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/nvda/quote), but costs quickly escalate if trading tiny securities with [wide bid-ask spreads](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/unwrapping-etf-wrapper). These costs detract from returns.\\\\n\\\\nOn a rebalance date, an ETF sometimes has no choice but to move a considerable portion of a small stock\u2019s outstanding share count. This is because index ETFs are beholden to their benchmark and have little negotiating power as forced buyers or sellers, sometimes causing them to settle for unfavorable prices. The difference can be pennies, but for hundreds of small stocks with positions totaling billions, it adds up. This makes an ETF\u2019s approach to rebalancing and turnover particularly important.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, small-cap indexes may be losing their luster. Many promising young companies are choosing to stay private for longer than they used to, seeking growth capital from [private instead of public](https://www.morningstar.com/lp/mutual-funds-and-unicorns) shareholders. If more companies follow suit and don\u2019t seek growth capital in public markets, popular small-cap indexes may lose some of their excitement and potential, shifting the investment case away from: \u201c[Tomorrow\u2019s big stocks are today\u2019s small stocks](https://www.ft.com/content/abfbf19e-f963-4c1b-b69e-7bef8896e8cd).\u201d Valuations suggest investors see greater potential in larger stocks today.\\\\n\\\\n[Read More: When Will Public and Private Markets Finally Converge?](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/when-will-public-private-equity-markets-finally-converge)\\\\n\\\\n## Assessing the Risks of Small-Cap ETFs\\\\n\\\\nThe [Morningstar Medalist Rating](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/why-were-enhancing-morningstar-medalist-rating) is conscious of the unique risks of small-cap ETFs. Funds that address these risks earn higher ratings than those that don\u2019t.\\\\n\\\\nIndex ETFs that screen for minimum liquidity ratios are viewed favorably because they make an index easier to track. Buffer rules at each rebalance are also important because they reduce turnover and associated trading costs. While not the only criteria considered, these are important building blocks of the best small-cap index funds.\\\\n\\\\nDiversified small-cap active ETFs may also be appealing. Actively managed ETFs from [Dimensional](https://www.morningstar.com/asset-management-companies/dimensional-BN000008KV) and [Avantis](https://www.morningstar.com/asset-management-companies/american-century-BN000007X7) spread risk across hundreds of small stocks and give managers trading flexibility to minimize transaction costs.\\\\n\\\\nAlong with other top-rated ETFs, small-cap ETFs earning Bronze, Silver, and Gold ratings are well-diversified, usually charge a low fee, and stand a good chance at beating their respective category benchmark.\\\\n\\\\n####  Five Undervalued Small-Cap ETFs \\\\n\\\\nSource: Morningstar. Data as of 01/31/2025.\\\\n\\\\nAs investor interest moves away from small caps and toward private equity or large-cap stocks, several small-cap ETFs are left undervalued, according to Morningstar\u2019s fair value estimate for ETFs. If stock prices converge with their fair value estimates, any of the ETFs noted above may offer compelling upside.\\\\n\\\\nThe author or authors do not own shares in any securities mentioned in this article.

Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding.\\\\n\\\\n## RISK CONSIDERATIONS \\\\n\\\\nThe value of investments held by the Fund may increase or decrease in response to economic, and financial events (whether real, expected or perceived) in the U.S. and global markets. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments is likely to decline. Investments in debt instruments may be affected by changes in the creditworthiness of the issuer and are subject to the risk of non-payment of principal and interest. The value of income securities also may decline because of real or perceived concerns about the issuer\\\\\\'s ability to make principal and interest payments. Investments rated below investment grade (sometimes referred to as \"junk\") are typically subject to greater price volatility and illiquidity than higher rated investments. Investments in foreign instruments or currencies can involve greater risk and volatility than U.S. investments because of adverse market, economic, political, regulatory, geopolitical, currency exchange rates or other conditions. Investing primarily in responsible investments carries the risk that, under certain market conditions, the Fund may underperform funds that do not utilize a responsible investment strategy. The Fund is exposed to liquidity risk when trading volume, lack of a market maker or trading partner, large position size, market conditions, or legal restrictions impair its ability to sell particular investments or to sell them at advantageous market prices. The impact of the coronavirus on global markets could last for an extended period and could adversely affect the Fund\u2019s performance. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should review the [Fund prospectus](https://morganstanley.prospectus-express.com/get_template.asp?clientid=morganstll&fundid=131582439&doctype=pros&template=calvert) for a complete description. \\\\n\\\\nSee the Fund\\\\\\'s prospectus for information related to a primary benchmark index selected (if applicable) to comply with a regulation that requires the Fund\\\\\\'s primary benchmark to represent the overall applicable market.\\\\n\\\\n  \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n1\\\\\\\\.

Effective February 1, 2025, the firm reduced fees on 168 share classes across 87 funds. The fee reductions are expected to save investors more than $350 million this year alone.1\\\\n\\\\n##### \\\\n\\\\nWhy investment costs matter\\\\n\\\\nVanguard Founder John C. Bogle explained why investment costs matter this way:\\\\n\\\\n_In investing, realize that you get what you_ don\u2019t _pay for. Whatever future returns the markets are generous enough to deliver, few investors will succeed in capturing 100% of those returns, simply because of the high costs of investing\u2014all those commissions, management fees, investment expenses, yes, even taxes\u2014so pare them to the bone. 2_\\\\n\\\\nMay 1 will mark Vanguard\u2019s 50th anniversary. All along, we have emphasized the importance of limiting the cost of investing. Lower costs leave more money in investors\u2019 funds and raise their potential returns. Indeed, across the industry, lower-cost funds have historically outperformed higher-cost funds on a net-of-expenses basis.3\\\\n\\\\n##### \\\\n\\\\nLower-cost portfolios tend to outperform higher-cost ones****\\\\n\\\\nAt Vanguard, we believe our funds\u2019 impressive long-term performance owes much to their low costs. For the 10 years ended December 31, 2024, 84% of our funds outpaced the average results of competing funds. The performance of our actively managed fixed income funds has been especially strong: 91% of our active bond funds and 100% of our money market funds have outpaced their peers\u2019 average results.4\\\\n\\\\n##### \\\\n\\\\nVanguard executives comment on fee reductions\\\\n\\\\nVanguard Chief Executive Officer Salim Ramji and President and Chief Investment Officer Greg Davis discuss the fee cuts in this brief video.\\\\n\\\\n#### Read the transcript\\\\n\\\\n**Massy Williams:** Salim, Greg, some very exciting news we have to share with investors: Vanguard announced the largest fee cut in our history, lowering expense ratios across 168 mutual fund and ETF share classes by a total of more than $350 million this year.\\\\n\\\\n**Salim Ramji:** Yeah, it is really exciting. This fee cut speaks to what our founder, Jack Bogle, set out to do, which was create an investment company that was designed for one constituency, and that\\\\\\'s our investors. Bogle had a great phrase: \u201cYou get what you _don\u2019t_ pay for.\u201d\\\\n\\\\n**Massy Williams:** That\u2019s correct.****\\\\n\\\\n**Salim Ramji:** There\u2019s a false dichotomy between, Do you want great performance or high quality, or do you want low costs? At Vanguard, you can get both. This is over $350 million of estimated savings\u2014the largest expense cut in our history. Since 1975, we\\\\\\'ve actually reduced our funds\\\\\\' expense ratios more than 2,000 times.\\\\n\\\\n**Greg Davis:** Lower fees mean fund investors can keep more of their returns and a competitive edge for our funds.\\\\n\\\\nWhen you think about our actively managed funds, our managers don\\\\\\'t have to take unnecessary risk to earn back our fees. Our financial model and structure creates a virtuous cycle of economies of scale, where we can continue to reduce fees and invest in things like technology and talent. And as a result, our edge just keeps getting sharper.\\\\n\\\\n**Massy Williams:** Thank you both. Just another example of our commitment to saving our investors over $350 million and helping to give them the best chance for investment success.\\\\n\\\\nRead more\\\\n\\\\n##### \\\\n\\\\nLargest Vanguard share classes with reduced fees*\\\\n\\\\n*New expense ratios effective February 1, 2025. Excludes Institutional Shares. Largest share classes reflect assets under management as of November 30, 2024. \\\\n\\\\nFollowing our latest fee cuts, Vanguard funds are less expensive than ever. Consider that:\\\\n\\\\n  * Overall, 86% of Vanguard mutual fund and ETF assets are in the lowest-cost deciles of their peer groups.5\\\\n  * Our average expense ratio for index fixed income ETFs is only 0.037%.6\\\\n  * Our active fixed income ETFs have an average expense ratio of 0.105%\u2014the lowest among leading issuers of such ETFs.7\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n##### \\\\n\\\\nFund fees and Vanguard fee cuts, explained \\\\n\\\\nOur lower fees are the estimated annual operating costs of the affected fund share classes, expressed as percentages of their average net assets. Also known as their expense ratios, the fees are detailed in the funds\u2019 prospectuses. The prospectuses of all affected funds were updated February 3 in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The amended prospectuses also are available on Vanguard\u2019s client-facing websites for:\\\\n\\\\n  * [Personal investors](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/list/all)\\\\n  * [Financial advisors](https://advisors.vanguard.com/investments/all)\\\\n  * [Institutional investors](https://institutional.vanguard.com/fund-list/?filters=&viewType=literature)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nOperating costs generally are deducted from the income that mutual funds and exchange-traded funds earn on their holdings. Expense ratios may cover investment advisory fees, marketing and distribution expenses, brokerage fees, and custodial, transfer agency, legal, and accounting fees.\\\\n\\\\n##### \\\\n\\\\nAll Vanguard share classes with reduced expense ratios, effective February 1, 2025\\\\n\\\\n1 Savings due to the reduction in expense ratios were calculated on a share class basis for each fund for which there is a Vanguard-initiated reduction. AUM as of November 30, 2024, for each relevant share class was multiplied by 2024 expense ratios. The same AUM data was then multiplied by 2025 reduced expense ratios. The difference was added across funds to determine the total estimated savings to Vanguard investors holding those funds in both 2024 and 2025.\\\\n\\\\n2 Speech delivered at The World Money Show, Orlando, Florida, February 2, 2005.\\\\n\\\\n3 See, for example, _Principles for Investing Success_ , Vanguard, 2023. \\\\n\\\\n4 Source: LSEG Lipper.

All data is as of Dec. 9, 2024.\\\\n\\\\n## Baird Short-Term Bond\\\\n\\\\n  * Morningstar Category: Short-Term Bond\\\\n  * Expense Ratio: 0.55%\\\\n  * Effective Duration: 1.85 years\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThis top-rated short-term bond fund is actively managed by an experienced team that invests in high-quality corporate bonds and securitized credit, as well as government bonds. The team keeps the fund\u2019s duration (a measure of interest-rate sensitivity) in line with the Bloomberg U.S. Government/Credit 1\u20133 Year Index\u2019s, and it adds value through adept security selection and sector allocation among corporate, securitized, and government bonds. The fund takes on more credit risk than its index, but it remains a good choice for investors in search of a conservative short-term bond fund, notes Morningstar Director [Alec Lucas](https://www.morningstar.com/people/alec-lucas).\\\\n\\\\n## JP Morgan Limited Duration Bond ETF\\\\n\\\\n  * Morningstar Category: Short-Term Bond\\\\n  * Expense Ratio: 0.24%\\\\n  * Effective Duration: N/A\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nJP Morgan converted this one-time mutual fund into an exchange-traded fund in mid-2023. The management team emphasizes short-term mortgage and asset-backed securities. Stringent security selection and stable duration are hallmarks of the strategy at this highly rated fund, which is why this ETF has been less volatile than some of its peers, explains Morningstar Senior Analyst Paul Olmsted. The managers also de-emphasize lower-yielding US Treasuries relative to their loose index, the Bloomberg 1-3 Year US Government/Credit Index.\\\\n\\\\n##  What Higher Bond Yields Mean for Markets in 2025 \\\\n\\\\nLong-term yields spiked after the election. \\\\n\\\\n16m 15s  Dec 6, 2024\\\\n\\\\nWatch\\\\n\\\\n## PGIM Short Duration Multi-Sector Bond Fund/ETF\\\\n\\\\n  * Morningstar Category: Short-Term Bond\\\\n  * Expense Ratio: 0.40% (mutual fund and ETF)\\\\n  * Effective Duration: 1.86 years\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNext on our list of the best short-term bond funds, PGIM Short Duration Multi-Sector Bond is an attractive option for investors willing to take on a bit more risk, says Morningstar Director [Eric Jacobson](https://www.morningstar.com/people/eric-jacobson). The managers of this top-rated fund attempt to outperform their benchmark, the Bloomberg US Government/Credit 1-3 Year Index, by 150 basis points annually with a flexible mandate that at times delves into non-US developed-and emerging-markets debt. The portfolio is often closer to the long end of its short-term bond Morningstar Category.\\\\n\\\\n[Read more: 3 Great Active ETFs for Bond Investors](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/3-great-active-etfs-bond-investors-3)\\\\n\\\\n## Schwab Short-Term US Treasury ETF\\\\n\\\\n  * Morningstar Category: Short-Term Government\\\\n  * Expense Ratio: 0.03%\\\\n  * Effective Duration: 1.88 years\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSchwab Short-Term US Treasury ETF is the first name on our list of the best short-term bond funds from the short-term government-bond category. This passive bond ETF tracks the Bloomberg US Treasury 1-3 Year Index. It\u2019s a tough fund to beat in its category, given the efficiency of the very liquid US Treasury bond market and the ETF\u2019s razor-thin expenses, explains Morningstar Analyst [Zachary Evens](https://www.morningstar.com/people/zachary-evens). Credit risk is nonexistent here, given its focus; interest-rate risk is damped with its focus on the short end of the yield curve.\\\\n\\\\n## More o\\\\n...(truncated)\\'}]', call_id='call_LLQLTNMItdS9MMesE3nkyW0P', is_error=False), FunctionExecutionResult(content='[{\\'title\\': \\'Bonds and the Yield Curve | Explainer | Education | RBA\\', \\'link\\': \\'https://www.rba.gov.au/education/resources/explainers/bonds-and-the-yield-curve.html\\', \\'snippet\\': \\'The yield curve for government bonds is an important indicator in financial markets.

[Explainer](https://www.rba.gov.au/education/resources/explainers/pdf/bonds-and-the-yield-curve.pdf) 173KB\\\\n\\\\nThe yield curve for government bonds is an important indicator in financial markets. It helps to determine how actual and expected changes in the policy interest rate (the cash rate in Australia), along with changes in other monetary policy tools, feed through to a broad range of interest rates in the economy. This Explainer has two parts: \\\\n\\\\n  * The first part outlines the concept of a bond and a bond yield. It also discusses the relationship between a bond\\'s yield and its price.\\\\n  * The second part explains how the yield curve is formed from a series of bond yields, and the different shapes the yield curve can take. It then discusses why the yield curve is an important indicator in financial markets and factors that can cause the yield curve to change.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Bonds\\\\n\\\\n### What is a bond?\\\\n\\\\nA bond is a loan made by an investor to a borrower for a set period of time in return for regular interest payments. The time from when the bond is issued to when the borrower has agreed to pay the loan back is called its \u2018term to maturity\u2019. There are government bonds (where a government is the borrower) and corporate bonds (where a business or a bank is the borrower). The main difference between a bond and a regular loan is that, once issued, a bond can be traded with other investors in a financial market. As a result, a bond has a market price. \\\\n\\\\nFor example, in the diagram below the Government has issued a bond to the value of $1 billion, which was purchased by an investor. The bond may then be traded with other investors in financial markets, at which point its market price can change (in this instance, it has become $1.01 billion). \\\\n\\\\n![Image showing how a government issues a bond to an investor in return for funds and then how that investor is able to trade that bond with other investors.](https://www.rba.gov.au/education/images/explainers/bonds-and-the-yield-curve/bonds-and-the-yield-curve-01.jpg)\\\\n\\\\n### What is a bond yield?\\\\n\\\\nA bond\\'s yield is the return an investor expects to receive each year over its term to maturity. For the investor who has purchased the bond, the bond yield is a summary of the overall return that accounts for the remaining interest payments and principal they will receive, relative to the price of the bond. For an issuer of a bond, the bond yield reflects the annual cost of borrowing by issuing a new bond. For example, if the yield on three-year Australian government bonds is 0.25 per cent, this means that it would cost the Australian government 0.25 per cent each year for the next three years to borrow in the bond market by issuing a new three-year bond. \\\\n\\\\nWhen a bond is issued, an investor has purchased the bond for the first time in a marketplace called the \u2018primary market\u2019. The initial price the investor pays for the bond depends on a number of factors, including the size of the interest payments promised, the term of the bond and the price of similar bonds already issued into the market. This information (including the price paid) is used to calculate the initial yield on the bond. Once a bond is issued, the investor is then able to trade that bond with other investors in the \u2018secondary market\u2019 and its price and yield may change with market conditions. \\\\n\\\\n###  What is the relationship between the price of a bond and its yield? \\\\n\\\\nThe prices at which investors buy and sell bonds in the secondary market move in the opposite direction to the yields they expect to receive (see Box below on \u2018Bond Prices and Yields \u2013 An Example\u2019). Once a bond is issued, it offers fixed interest payments to its owner over its term to maturity, which does not change. However, interest rates in financial markets change all the time and, as a result, new bonds that are issued will offer different interest payments to investors than existing bonds. \\\\n\\\\nFor example, suppose interest rates fall. New bonds that are issued will now offer lower interest payments. This makes existing bonds that were issued before the fall in interest rates more valuable to investors, because they offer higher interest payments compared to new bonds. As a result, the price of existing bonds will increase. However, if a bond\\'s price increases it is now more expensive for a potential new investor to buy. The bond\\'s yield will then fall because the return an investor expects from purchasing this bond is now lower. \\\\n\\\\n![Image showing how bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.](https://www.rba.gov.au/education/images/explainers/bonds-and-the-yield-curve/bonds-and-the-yield-curve-02.jpg)\\\\n\\\\n## Box: Bond Pr\\\\n...(truncated)\"}, {\\'title\\': \\'Municipal Bonds: Back in the Spotlight | J.P.

Instruments for Moderate-Risk Retirement Portfolio\n\n---\n\n### **Investment-Grade Corporate Bonds**\n1. **Calvert High Yield Bond Fund (I) (CYBIX)**\n   - **5-Year Annualized Return**: ~3.24%\n   - **Expense Ratio (Net)**: 0.77%\n   - **Top Holdings**:\n     - Charter Communications: 1.88%\n     - NRG Energy Inc.: 1.54%\n   - **Objective**: Focused on high current income with moderate appreciation potential.\n   - **Key Considerations**: Balances risk in corporate bonds with relatively low expense ratios.\n\n2. **Vanguard Short-Term Corporate Bond Index ETF (VCSH)**\n   - **Expense Ratio**: 0.05%\n   - **Investment Objective**: Short-term corporate bonds for liquidity-focused strategies.\n   - **Performance**: Offers interest income with low duration risk amidst shifting rate environments.\n   - **Suitability**: Ideal for reducing risk in an environment of volatile interest rates.\n\n---\n\n### **Government Bonds**\n1. **Schwab Short-Term US Treasury ETF (SCHO)**\n   - **Expense Ratio**: 0.03%\n   - **Average Duration**: ~1.88 years\n   - **Yield**: Tied to short-term U.S. Treasury market.\n   - **Risk Profile**: Guarantees principal safety compared to higher-yielding options but with lower returns.\n\n2. **Vanguard Short-Term Treasury ETF (VGSH)**\n   - **Expense Ratio**: 0.04%\n   - **Performance**:\n     - Designed for low-risk investments that closely follow U.S. government bond trends.\n   - **Key Insights**: Balances income versus rate sensitivity.\n\n---\n\n### **Risk-Return Comparisons: Government vs. High-Yield Bonds**\n1. **Government Bonds**\n   - Safeguard principal; returns are lower but come with near-zero default risk.\n   - Critical during periods of economic uncertainty or as retirement approaches to stabilize the portfolio.\n\n2. **High-Yield Bonds (Calvert Fund Example)**\n   - 10-Year Average Return (e.g., ~4.12%) is higher but paired with credit risk.\n   - Suitable for portfolios with moderate risk tolerance within diversified exposure.\n\n---\n\n### Insights for Portfolio Strategy\n1. **Blend Recommendation**:\n   - 50% Allocation \u2013 Corporate Bonds (e.g., Vanguard or Calvert funds for higher yield with moderated credit risks).\n   - 50% Allocation \u2013 Government Treasuries (e.g., SCHO, VGSH for principal protection and steady income).\n\n2. **Risk Mitigation**:\n   - Adjust exposure through periodic rebalancing to gradually tilt towards safer government-backed options as retirement nears.\n\nWould you like to explore any further comparisons, such as emerging market bonds or inflation-protected options?

Backdoor Roth conversion for additional tax-advantaged space if income exceeds Roth limits.  \n\n2. **Tax-Loss Harvesting:**  \n   - Offset taxable investment income by selling underperforming securities in taxable accounts when applicable.   \n\n3. **Municipal Bonds for Taxable Accounts**  \n   - Consider municipal bonds for higher-income clients to earn tax-free interest.  \n\n---\n\n### **Portfolio Risk Optimization**\n1. **Risk Metrics**:  \n   - Expected Portfolio Return (historical averages): ~7.3% annually.  \n   -

Reduce portfolio beta by prioritizing large-cap equities, government bonds, and cash allocation.  \n\n---\n\n### **Monitoring and Adjustments**  \n- Portfolio performance and client circumstances should be reviewed annually to ensure alignment with long-term goals.  \n\nPORTFOLIO READY.  \n---------- verifier ----------\n**VERIFIED**  \n\nThe portfolio proposal aligns with the client's profile, risk tolerance, and retirement goals.
